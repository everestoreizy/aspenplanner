# Aspen Planner
A homework planner for students based around the concept of always having a plan for when you're going to do your assignments - not just knowing when they're due. I'm having trouble getting it to deploy anywhere so right now it's only available as a NetBeans project (download and unzip the whole repo and open that with NetBeans.)
